## Introduction

Cypress is a wonderful tools for front-end end-to-end testing and with
[Cypress Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/)
from [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) it makes so much fun and easy to
write end to end testing. We can also use to automate some stuff like when we
are building a long multi page form, and every time we need to fill up the first
or second page to get working on the third page, we can easily automate this
with Cypress, in that way we also getting our confidence by writing test. Now in
this kind of scenario we might need `Redux Dev Tool`. But you see, in our
Cypress window we will not be able at access our favorite `Redux Dev Tool`
